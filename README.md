remote home pc automation i built a python system using a termux listener on a tablet that acts as a bridge between telegram and my pc. i used telethon to turn the telegram app into a custom frontend so i can send commands from my phone to trigger wake on lan or launch games etc over the local network. it uses a secure config setup to hide private keys and handles the full phone to tablet to pc automation flow so i can control my hardware from anywhere.
